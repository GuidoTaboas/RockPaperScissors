Rock, Paper, Scissors

Even though this is a fairly simple project, it has helped me with a few things:

  1) When I first coded this project, I did not think about a visual interface for it, so when the moment to add it came, 
     I had to rework my code to adapt to the clicks of the user, this is a very different way to code, and it was really interesting to learn about it.
  
  2) The necessity to work with 3 languages together was very interesting as well, because when a problem arised, 
     I had to look into the 3 different files of code to find what was causing it.
     
  3) The last thing, for which I am very grateful, is that before I have never asked online when I had a doubt, however, this time was different,
     and the people from TOP Discord were incredibly nice and helpful.
     
This is just the beginning of a long path, excited to see what comes, and how will I think of this code when I look back ;)
